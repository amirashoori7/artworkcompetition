COMPETITION HISTORY

The Math Art competition is an innovative, practical project that resulted from the need to promote creativity in problem solving by encouraging learners to explore the real-life links between mathematics and the arts (which is the aim of the STEAM concept in education). 
 The Govan Mbeki Mathematics Development Centre (GMMDC) launched the Math-Art competition project in the Eastern Cape high schools in March 2018. The MATH-ART competition was piloted with the support of the Nelson Mandela University’s School of Music, Art and Design (SoMAD), and the Department of Basic Education in the Eastern Cape region.
Entrants were required to come up with their own concept of Math-Art, within a suggested scope. The entry had to include a 300-word description of how their artwork linked maths and art.  There were two age categories: Grades 8 & 9 and Grades 10 to 12.  Judging was mostly based on the creativity in linking mathematics and arts.
The pilot competition was overwhelmingly successful.  It attracted 113 entries, mostly from learners in 36 previously-disadvantaged schools in the Eastern Cape.  Most of the entries were exhibited at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Art Museum in Port Elizabeth in May 2018. 
The MATH-ART project has attracted the attention of the international Bridges organisation, an institution with whom GMMDC has had a collaboration since 2017 via an Erasmus Mundus research project funded by the European Union.  
Thirty MATH-ART entries from South Africa were part of an invited exhibit at the annual International Bridges Conference which took place at the National Museum of Science and Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, in July 2018.
As a result of this interest, the project was expanded – with the support of Umalusi and the Department of Basic Education - to a national competition in 2019.

593 entries were received from 75 schools in the 8 provinces in South Africa. All the entries were exhibited once again at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Art Museum in Port Elizabeth in June 2019.  Once again, the best entries were invited to exhibit at the International Bridges Conference in July, this time in Linz, Austria.
The collaboration between the GMMDC and the Bridges organisation will continue as the competition expands every year and more stakeholders have expressed a keen interest to join this project as it seeks to promote STEAM education with the emphasis on integrating innovation and creativity as vital skills to meet the challenges of 4IR.
