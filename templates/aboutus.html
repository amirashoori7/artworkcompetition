<div>ABOUT US
The Govan Mbeki Mathematics Development Centre (GMMDC), a self-funded engagement centre within the School of Computing Science, 
Mathematics & Applied Mathematics, Physics and Statistics at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, was created in 2002 in order 
specifically to find ways to improve teaching and learning of maths and science in South African schools.
 Between 2009 and 2016 the activities of the entity expanded exponentially.  
 Modern technology -  especially mobile telephony and interactive computing - was harnessed to create off-line curriculum-based teaching and learning methods for high schools and FET colleges.  
 These methods are constantly being updated and extended through ongoing research and testing.  
 This approach - dubbed the Techno-Blended Model (TBM) - combines ICT technology, show-and-tell videos and presentations, motivational activities, support services, integrated and inter-active teaching methods, and organised workshops, Saturday study groups and the use of teaching volunteers to make maths and science accessible to teachers and learners alike.
 A range of projects have been implemented over the last five years, and they serve as a working laboratory to develop more effective ways of teaching and learning of maths and science. Included in these are SACE accredited professional development programmes for educators, structured Tablet-assisted incubation programmes for learners and school-based after-hours support platforms and programmes.
 Most importantly, the GMMDC in 2017 adopted the STEAM educational approach in 2017, which emphasises the role of using creativity, innovation and teamwork in problem-solving, which has been identified as the most crucial skill required for the jobs of the future.  This STEAM educational approach is emphasised through quizzes, competitions, exhibitions and group activities.
 Vision of the GMMDC:
 To improve the quality of Mathematics and Physical Sciences teaching and learning at TVET College/Secondary School level across South Africa;
To promote the integrated use of relevant 21st century technologies in the teaching and learning of Mathematics and Physical Sciences;
To promote public awareness of the importance of the study of Mathematics and Physical Sciences as gateway subjects for access to Higher Education and for economic growth in South Africa;
To promote STEAM* education at schools and TVET colleges against the background of the skills needs of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
 * STEAM - Science Technology Engineering Arts and Mathematics - STEAM education is a modern way to teach how all things relate to each other, in school and in life. It's more relevant than traditional learning styles and makes more sense to all types of learners because it is based on the natural ways that people learn and are interested in things.
